# Neural-Networks-Final-Project
This project applies deep learning techniques to the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset as well as a normalized version of dataset from anomaly detection. Because fraud cases are extremely rare and hidden within complex, nonlinear patterns, we develop and evaluate a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model trained with class-balancing techniques to address the severe imbalance. The MLP learns nonlinear relationships in the PCA-transformed features and produces strong discrimination between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The results demonstrate that deep learning, specifically MLP architectures, can effectively identify anomalies in financial datasets, offering a foundation for real-world fraud detection systems.
